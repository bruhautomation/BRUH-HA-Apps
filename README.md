## Add-ons

### [brAIn](brain/)

**Give your smart home a mind.** Claude inside Home Assistant with full run of the place — every entity, every device, every area, floor, label, dashboard, helper, automation and add-on. One add-on, one sidebar panel, one Claude login, running on your own Claude subscription.

It **administers** your setup (36 native tools, 65 registry-management services, and a real shell in `/config`), **finds what's broken** and offers to fix it, **explains your house** in insight cards built for your data, **remembers** what you tell it in one document everything else reads, **talks** as an Assist conversation agent, and **can be undone** — every file it writes is snapshotted first.
